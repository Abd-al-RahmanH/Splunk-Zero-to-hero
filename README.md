## Understanding Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)

SPL is the language used to perform searches and queries in Splunk. Mastering SPL is key to making the most out of Splunk’s capabilities. Some commonly used SPL commands include:

- `search`: Search for events that match a specified condition.
- `stats`: Perform statistical calculations like count, sum, average, etc.
- `eval`: Create new fields or modify existing ones using expressions.
- `where`: Filter results based on specific conditions.
- `table`: Display results in a table format.

### Example Search Queries
```spl
index=_internal | stats count by source
index=web | where status_code=200 | table source, status_code
```
